<p>Dr. Graham,</p>

<p>Thanks for a great semester! Here are some notes for your review of my final project.</p>

<p>There is a <a href="/infinite">scrolling</a> version of the timeline, and <a href="/">the main one</a> where you can control the speed.</p>

<p>I included some "general" events mixed in with the Christian-specific ones for context. </p>

<p>The <a href="/references">references page</a> shows all of the sources used to create the timeline.</p>

<p>Everything was coded from scratch. I literally opened a blank text editor and typed out the Python, HTML, CSS and JavaScript required to make this work. I am only telling you this so you know I put a considerable amount of time into the project in addition to the scholarly research.</p>


<p>This is exactly what I have been looking for an excuse to work on, so thank you! The long term goal is to take this exact code and use it for a broader scope timeline. Future goals also include slicing the data in different ways (by region or category for example) and a zoom functionality for the timeline itself. </p>

<p>Thanks again,</p>

<h2> Additional Questions & Responses</h2>
<h3>Why was there such a definitive break between Christianity and the cultures in which it was embedded?</h3>
<p>It was difficult to find hypotheses in the literature about this particular question. However, Boswell lays out some theories as to why Christianity became so intolerant of homosexuals that are a close response to the question at hand. He admits that these theories are based on a time period for which we have very little information, so should be considered conjecture at best.</p>

<p>Firstly, he believes that increasing ruralization of the formerly urban cultural centers of Roman civilization was a factor in the changing attitude of Christians towards homosexuals. “The exhaustion of the urban elite was already noticeable in the second century and grew steadily worse in the third and fourth as political instability, economic change, social disruptions, natural disasters, and the lower birth rate of the wealthy wiped out large numbers of Rome’s noble families. “ (Boswell, 119)</p>

<p>In addition, he talked about how the control of the empire had shifted into the hands of armies and generals, and that few of the emperors after the first century were born in Rome. Eventually, external forces stormed and took the city of Rome itself, not content to allow it to decay at its own pace, and imposed their own value systems on it from without (Boswell, 120) Although, he notes, changing attitudes started before these barbarians and invaders took over.</p>

<p>Another factor he cites is the increasing absolutism of Roman government. This lead to greater totalitarian control over personal aspects of Romans’ lives. Christians also had an intolerance for paganism, and there were some associations of homosexuality with paganism that may have also roused suspicion against it (Boswell, 144). He believes that this is what also caused intolerance in the later Middle ages too. Boswell explains that there was a period of tolerance of most minorities in the early middle ages. But: “perhaps the single most prominent aspect of the period from the later twelfth to the fourteenth century was a sedulous quest for intellectual and institutional uniformity and corporatism throughout Europe. This trend not only resulted in the strengthening and consolidation of civil and ecclesiastical power and administrative machinery but left its mark on less concrete monuments of European culture as well. Theology was fitted into systematic formulas and collected into comprehensive compendia… “</p>

<p>Other authors put a more intense focus on the Bible and the “signal instance” of the overthrow of Sodom and Gomorrah as the theological factors which have contributed to the formation of the traditional Western Christian attitude to homosexual practices (Bailey, 153). I too wondered if religions that put heavy emphasis on their scriptures/written texts seem to be more hostile towards homosexuals becaues of the wide variety of interpretations possible for these texts. </p>

<h3>More recent theological perspectives on homosexuality?</h3>

<p>It seems to me personally that in more conservative circles, the Bible is still a legitimate argument against homosexuality. However, most scholars (and seemingly, society in general in modern times) seem to be of the opinion that the Bible itself is not enough to deem homosexuality as “wrong” or immoral. Most contemporary authors seem to have moved on to different arguments, like discussing natural law or putting modern scientific findings into discussion with the theological and ethical arguments surrounding homosexuality. The science is still being sorted out, but as we learn more modern theologians begin to answer questions "does science determining a 'cause' of homosexuality change how we look at it theologically and if so, how?" For example, if homosexuality is genetic does that then make it acceptable to the church? What place does scientific research have in shaping the church's response to homosexuality? </p>

<p>In her recent book Theology and Sexuality, Sarah Cornwall explains about recent findings in queer theology: “More recently, queer theologians and biblical scholars have expanded the kinds of work they do. Although queer theology and biblical studies are particularly invested in questioning why heterosexuality is considered superior to homosexuality in many societies and religious traditions, queer interpretation is not exclusively concerned with sexuality. Queer readers also call into question why particular races, classes, genders and bodies have often been considered more perfect or legitimate than others in religious terms. Queer interpreters have worked closely with black, feminist, womanist, liberationist, and postcolonial theologians. They are interested in power, and how one group comes to have power over another. Whose ideas become the influential, accepted ones in any given society? What are the processes by which this happens? If the powerful voices in a religious community, the ‘gatekeepers’ of a community’s activity and doctrine, are also the voice privileged by society in general – which might mean white, male, heterosexual, educated, economically stable voices in particular – then to what extent can religious traditions be sources of hope for those whose perspectives are not considered normative? Rachel Muers characterizes queer theology simply as ‘a critical and constructive rereading of established categories of sex and gender from a Christian theological perspective’. On this reading, queer theology is not only or exclusively to be concerned with or done by homosexual people.” (Cornwall, 138).</p>
